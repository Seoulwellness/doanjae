# Project Guidelines for Responsive Landing Page

## Responsive Design Requirements
- Always use mobile-first approach
- Standard breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- Test components on multiple screen sizes
- Use Tailwind responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:)
- Implement container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Ensure all images are responsive using Next.js Image component

## Animation & Transition Best Practices
- Use Tailwind CSS for simple transitions (hover, focus, color changes)
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations (page transitions, scroll animations, complex sequences)
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility
- Use `will-change` and `transform` properties for GPU acceleration
- Lazy load animations using Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Keep animations performant on mobile devices
- Create reusable animation variants in `lib/animations.ts`

## Language
- Site is in Korean (한국어)
- All text content should be in Korean
- Use Korean fonts (Noto Sans KR) for proper rendering

## SEO Standards
- All pages must have proper metadata (title, description)
- Include Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Include Twitter Card metadata
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) where appropriate
- Use proper HTML lang attribute based on locale
- Include responsive viewport meta tag
- Use semantic HTML elements

## Accessibility (a11y)
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations
- Ensure keyboard navigation works on all interactive elements
- Add proper ARIA labels where needed
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure focus management for animations

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed ('use client')
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)

## Theme & Design System
- Use design tokens from theme configuration
- Maintain consistent typography scale
- Use consistent spacing scale
- Follow color palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutral)
- Support dark mode using existing CSS variables
- Use theme utilities for consistent styling

## Performance
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Use code splitting appropriately
- Monitor bundle size with bundle analyzer
- Implement proper error boundaries
